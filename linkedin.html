                        <strong>Choose Reason for Leaving</strong><br>
                        Select a reason from the list (required)<br>
                        Optionally provide additional feedback
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enter Your Password</strong><br>
                        For security verification, enter your account password
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Confirm Closure</strong><br>
                        Check the confirmation box acknowledging you understand the consequences<br>
                        Click "Close account" or "Next" to finalize
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2>Direct Link Method</h2>
            <p>You can also access the account closure page directly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/account-management" target="_blank" style="color: #e74c3c;">linkedin.com/psettings/account-management</a></li>
                <li>Scroll to "Closing your LinkedIn account" and follow the steps above</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alternative: Hibernate Your Account</h2>
            <p>LinkedIn offers a "hibernation" mode that hides your profile without deleting it:</p>
            <div class="steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to Settings & Privacy → Account preferences → Hibernation</li>
                    <li>Toggle on "Hibernate account"</li>
                    <li>Your profile will be hidden from search and your network</li>
                    <li>You can reactivate anytime by logging back in</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="info">
                <strong>💡 Note:</strong> Hibernation keeps your data stored on LinkedIn's servers. It's only hidden from public view and can be reactivated at any time.
            </div>

            <h2>What Happens After Deletion?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your profile is immediately removed from LinkedIn</li>
                <li>Your name and profile information will no longer appear in search results</li>
                <li>All your connections, messages, and endorsements are deleted</li>
                <li>Content you've posted may remain visible for a short time in caches</li>
                <li>LinkedIn may retain some data for legal compliance and business purposes</li>
                <li>You can create a new account later, but you'll start from scratch</li>
                <li>Your email address will be available for creating a new account after some time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>After Closing Your Account</h2>
            <p>Consider these steps for complete removal:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Remove LinkedIn from any apps that use it for authentication</li>
                <li>Clear your browser cookies and cache</li>
                <li>Check if recruiters or colleagues have copies of your profile/resume</li>
            </ul>
