                <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> When you deactivate your X account, it will be hidden for 30 days before permanent deletion. During this period, you can restore it by logging back in. After 30 days, your account and all data are permanently deleted.

                <p>X allows you to download an archive of your tweets and data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to Settings and privacy → Your account → Download an archive of your data</li>
