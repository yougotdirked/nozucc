            <h2>Alternative: Deactivate or Take a Break</h2>

                <li>Remove the app from your devices to avoid temptation</li>
                <li>Change your password to a random string and don't save it (effectively locking yourself out)</li>

            <h2>Understanding the AT Protocol</h2>
            <div class="info">
                <p>Bluesky is built on the decentralized AT Protocol, which means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your data may exist on multiple servers (Personal Data Servers or PDS)</li>
                    <li>Deleting from the main Bluesky server should remove your data</li>
                    <li>If you used a custom PDS, you may need to manage deletion there separately</li>
                    <li>The protocol design aims to give users control over their data</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Post-Deletion Steps</h2>
            <p>After deleting your account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the Bluesky app from your devices</li>
                <li>Clear browser cookies and cache if you used the web version</li>
                <li>Unsubscribe from any Bluesky emails</li>
                <li>Consider alternatives like decentralized platforms or taking a social media break</li>
            </ul>
