# No Zucc!
Open source project to destroy social media.

# What is this project?
The goal of this project is simple: make it as easy as possible for people to delete as much of their social media accounts as possible. We aim to reduce the hold of big-tech companies over society.

# Hybrid warfare
The project consists of 3 components:
1. this repository
2. a hosted instance of the website
3. images to share in physical pages*

*these images should be easily downloadable for visitors. They should be printed in the form of stickers, calling more people to the cause. We hope to level the plahing field by engaging in physical spaces

# Community
This project is open source in nature. We want to engage people in their own language as much as possible. Platforms keep changing their ways to delete them, using dark patterns to retain users.
By crowd sourcing knowledge of determined people we hope to keep the systems up to date
